# BandwagonHost For Android

BandwagonHost for android is a material design style android client for [BandwagonHost](https://bandwagonhost.com).  
I used the BandwagonHost control panel provide RESTful styled API to develop it. The architecture is MVP, it's simplify to the codes.

## Features

1. Look up the hosts details and usaged etc.
2. Control operations such as restarting the host switch.
3. Reinstall system for your hosts.
4. Switch the location for your hosts, and you can look up the location on the maps.
5. Backup your host system images.
6. Add or delete IPv6 address by your hosts.
7. Send command to your hosts.
8. Reset your hosts the root password.

## How to use it ?

You must provide the `APIKey` and `VEID`. But it is worth noting that, this project can not by any way to steal yours `APIkey` and `VEID`.  
If you unbelieve it, you can look the fucking source code.

2. Click your screen bottom right corner "+" to add the host, finished.
3. Enjoy it!
